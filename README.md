# twitter-reply-bot

This is a simple bot that replies to a tweet when its url is given as an input to the program.

# Pre-requisites

Install Python 3.

Install Tweepy using the command ``pip3 install tweepy``.

# Execution

Simply copy paste the link of the tweet you want to reply to then execute twitbot.py.

# Note

I will change the values in the keys.py after some time after which the program won't run. You would need to create your own app from 
https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps to continue using the program.
